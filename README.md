# Auto-Correct-System


### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
This repository holds the source code for a simple auto-correct system created using NLP principles and methods.



### INTRODUCTION:
Almost everyone in this digital age carries a smartphone, it can be an Android or iOS device. Autocorrect uses natural language processing as its foundation (NLP). It is designed to fix spelling and other text-entry errors. On our smartphones, we commonly utilise autocorrect models when messaging on sites like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and others. This project would be merely a Natural Language Processing application on a smaller dataset—Shakespeare.txt—and is undoubtedly not an identical replica of the smartphone we currently use.


### STEPS FOR BUILIDING AN AUTO-CORRECT MODEL:
Building an autocorrect model that corrects spelling mistakes involves the following 4 steps:


**Step 1:** Identify the misspelled word


**Step 2:** Find strings that are n edit changes away


**Step 3:** Filter Candidates

**Step 4:** Compute the probabilities for the suggestions



### CONCLUSIONS:
